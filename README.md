<h1 align="center">Top Ranked UFC Athletes by Division</h1>
<img src="Photos/UFC Athletes.jpg" width=100%>

In this project, I examine the UFC's ranked male athletes in each of the eight weight divisions to determine which attributes are correlated with success in the octagon. There are 15 ranked UFC athletes in each division as well as won champion and therefore I will be examining 128 of the 483 active male fighters in the UFC's roster. The dataset, which I created using data from the UFC's official <a href="https://www.ufc.com/rankings">website</a>, can be downloaded <a href="Datasets/male_ranks.xlsx">here</a>. Note that the ranking information was collected on December 31, 2020 and may have been updated since.

The primary objective of this project is to understand which types of athletes are most likely to succeed in the UFC. This is useful for predicting who will be champ in the future as well as for bettors in determining which people are most likely to win in a fight. However, my main reason for starting this project is to understand more about the athletes in the sport I love so much. 

After cleaning up the dataset and creating some new statistics to examine, I will investigate the following:
- Differences between the weight divisions in which attributes are correlated with athlete success
- Testing my personal theories about correlations between various statistical attributes
- Which attributes champions possess that make them exception when compared to the contenders in their divisions
- Which areas of the globe have the most talent in the UFC
- Where these ranked UFC athletes train and which MMA gyms are the best in the world
- The extremities of each statistic, suhc as which fighters have the most fights, which fighters are undefeated, which fighters are shortest, etc.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, all sports suffered tremendously in 2020. However, the UFC was the major first sport's organization to safely return from the hiatus and put on sporting events once again, and they should be commended for that in my opinion.
